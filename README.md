# MPhil-thesis

The source code in this repository is aimed to be the Appendix of my MPhil thesis, titled **Functional Programming and Non-Distributivity in Pathfinding problems** submitted to The University of Nottingham. As such, detailed explanation of functions definitions and their proofs are in the thesis document.

In order to have a logical sequence of the code, we organized this repository as follows:
+ **Nilsson.hs** contains the Nilsson's functions for all the variety of implementations, say lazy, strict, path-tracking and non path-tracking versions.
+ **frw*.hs** contains the all-pairs shortest path or Floyd-Roy-Warshall versions. 
+ **ss*.hs** have the single-source shortest path implementations.
+ **k*.hs** are the files comprising the knapsack implementations.
+ [David's King PhD thesis] (http://theses.gla.ac.uk/1629/1/1996kingphd.pdf) is the reference for the _random graphs_ generation.
